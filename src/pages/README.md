# About pages folder

The new page always contains the following file structure.

index.js - for reexport
styles.scss
page-name.jsx
page-name.actions.js
page-name.types.js
page-name.reducer.js
page-name.operations.js

Examples of code structure are left in the relevant files.

!!! IMPORTANT !!!
If you have a component that is not reusable then you need to create a components folder and place it there.
