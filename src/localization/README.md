# About localization folder

There should only be only localization JSONs. If you want to add new language, just create new folder based on EN folder and connect it in i18n.js file. 
The file must be divided by the pages where it is used.
For forms and other small components, you should create a separate localization file.
For example here is EN folder files structure:
index.js
dashboard.json
registration.json
forms.json
